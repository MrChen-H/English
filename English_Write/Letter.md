    dear Peter
        
        Perter are you ok? I heard from Email that there was an earthquake in your homtown.Oh my God,that's so
    terrible,You and your family are not injured,right? 
       I konw you are very sad but the earthquake has already happened and We are can't change the facts. I think
    now you should walking out from sad.
        As far as I know,you should found some food and water after the earthquake, which is very important.You 
    and your family should move to an open area and not near building to avoid a second earthquake.
       Peter Don't give up.It will be fine,I belive you are a strong man,May God bless you and your family.
